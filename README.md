# iCountryStats
Shiny app to display reactive iRacing statistics on a web page

## To note:
Currently the app downloads and prepares the statistics data once a day when first run. It's better to comment the download and e.g. run a cron script to download the data.

TODO:
- Description & instructions
- Tidy the graphics, especially scaling/size
